          The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The
          term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which
          means 'work'.[2] According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the
          first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also
          states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen
          (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old
          French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil). In English,
          people still occasionally use the words travail, which means struggle.
          According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales
          (2004), the words travel and travail both share an even more ancient
          root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it
          means "three stakes", as in to impale). This link may reflect the
          extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times
          may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination. Travel
          to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and
          adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can also
          be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by bus,
          cruise ship, or even by bullock cart.
